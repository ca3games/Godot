Here I post whatever I make with Godot.

My code is licensed under GPLv3.
My art assets are licenced under Creative commons atribution non comercial.

Basically the TL:DR is the following:
Is ok to use my code and assets as the basis of your game.
Is not ok to simply copy paste my work and make money off it.
Is ok to make commercial derivative work off this github as long as you're a small indie developer and you make enough original work, not just copy paste my work.
If you're a corporation seeking to make a commercial deal, fuck off.

You're encourage to try to fix bugs or improve this github projects or port the files and do homebrew with it, or you need placeholder assets and code to study, I'll be happy my work serves as inspiration and help to you, just don't try to simply copy paste my work.
Also, pls give the proper credits on your work, I'm not asking anything else.
